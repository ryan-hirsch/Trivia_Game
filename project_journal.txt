ATTEMPTING AT MAKING BUTTON RESPOND

First atttempt:

const nextButton = document.getElementById('next-button');

nextButton.addEventListener('click', nextClicked);

function nextClicked() {
    console.log('You did it!')
};

-- Got error: Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'addEventListener')

Troubleshooting:
First things I found when trying to figure out why I was getting this error, was that
the addEventListener was being called on a jQuery object. Didn't know what this meant
but copied their syntax with my specific things and still didn't work.

I was looking at the error again and it was saying that the properties were null.
There are clearly properties in the function in the app.js so why would it say it as null?

So, then I started thinking about how the html/css/js interact when loading this site.
